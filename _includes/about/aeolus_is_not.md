What Aeolus is NOT
------------------

To provide further clarity, it's useful to know what Aeolus **isn't**.

Aeolus is not:

-   **A part of Linux**   
     Although our packaging efforts currently focus on Linux, Aeolus is
    not explicitly tied into Linux. It is a suite of applications that
    run on Linux and related operated systems.   

-   **Owned by Red Hat**   
     Although the majority of Aeolus developers are currently sponsored
    by Red Hat, the project is an independent community effort.   

-   **Not a cloud**   
     Aeolus is a project for managing existing clouds (public and
    private), not an attempt at creating yet another one.
