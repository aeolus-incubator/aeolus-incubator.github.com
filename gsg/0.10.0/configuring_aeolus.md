Configuring Aeolus 0.10.0
=========================

These next pages get you up and running with Aeolus using our **Getting
Started Guide**.

They take you through initial configuration, connecting with Amazon EC2
or the mock provider, then doing very simple instance management with
it.

## Initial configuration

Most configuration for Aeolus is done through its web interface.

To turn on this web interface, we take a few simple steps:

1.  [Run aeolus-configure](#aeolus-configure)
2.  [Update the firewall](#update-firewall) (if it's on)
</div>

### 1. Run aeolus-configure

The very first step is to run the *aeolus-configure* command **with**
super-user privileges (via sudo).

    $ sudo /usr/sbin/aeolus-configure -p ec2,mock

This performs an initial configuration of Aeolus with default settings,
along with pre-configured provider information for Amazon EC2 and the
mock provider.

It is fully automatic, and doesn't require any input. It will take a
while (can be several minutes), generating a fair amount of text.

As part of this automatic configuration each Aeolus component is
initialized, a PostgreSQL database is created, and the web interface is
activated.

<div class="note">
**NOTE -** Aeolus-configure can be passed other options, which you may
want to investigate at your leisure. For this introduction though,
they're not really needed.

### 2. Update the firewall

Because Aeolus uses an encrypted web interface, the server running it
must accept connections on TCP port 443.

If a firewall is running on the Aeolus server, it needs updating to
allow those connections.

For the standard iptables firewall on Fedora or RHEL, use this command:

    $ sudo lokkit -s https

<div class="note">
**USEFUL NOTE -** You can additionally open TCP port 80, for users to
attempt connecting via standard http.

Aeolus automatically redirects them to the secure port.
