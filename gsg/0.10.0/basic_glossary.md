## 1. Provider Type and Provider

Cloud provider types include Amazon EC2, RHEV-M, Rackspace, etc. A
provider is simply an instance of a provider type - for example, an EC2
region such as us-east-1. Users may have one or multiple accounts
associated with a provider.

This guide will configure Aeolus for EC2, as well as a "Mock" provider
for those without an available EC2 account. The mock provider is simply
a fake provider used for testing.
</div>
<br />

<div class="section-grouping">
## 2. Instance

An instance is a single virtual machine running on a provider.
</div>
<br />

<div class="section-grouping">
## 3. Image

A Conductor image contains provider-independent metadata that Aeolus can
use to generate disk images on supported providers.

This guide will create an image for Fedora 16.
</div>
<br />

<div class="section-grouping">
## 4. Deployable and Deployment

A deployable references one or more images, along with the appropriate
hardware profiles for those images.

A deployable is lauched as a deployment. A deployment consists of one or
more instances controlled as a group, such as a database server, an
application server, and multiple front-end web servers.
</div>
<br />

<div class="section-grouping">
## 5. Pool

A pool is a grouping of instances and deployables. Aeolus provides tools
for managing pools, allowing the user to easily manage functions such as
administrative rights, permissions, and quotas.
</div>
<br />

<div class="section-grouping">
## 6. Catalog

A catalog contains one or more deployables. Each catalog is associated
with a single pool.
