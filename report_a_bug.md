How to report a bug
===================

If you've discovered a bug with Aeolus, please let us know, so we can
fix it.

<div class="section-grouping">
Security related bugs
---------------------

If your bug is security related, and you don't want the details publicly
viewable, please email our security team directly, using the **Security
related** details on the [Contact](contact.html) page.

Bugs not related to security
----------------------------

We use Red Hat's Bugzilla system for bug reports. You'll need to create
an account on it if you don't have one.

It's easy, and doesn't cost anything.

<br />

### Step 1 - Create a new Bugzilla account

Follow [this link](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/createaccount.cgi) to
create a new Bugzilla account. You only need to do this if you don't
already have a Red Hat Bugzilla account.

Then move on to the next step.

<br />

### Step 2 - Create a new bug report

Follow [this
link](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?classification=Red%20Hat&product=CloudForms%20Cloud%20Engine)
to create the new bug report.

In the bug report form, only the **Component** and **Summary** fields
are required. The rest are optional, but please fill out the
**Description** field as well if possible.

If you're not sure which **Component** to choose, pick the
*Distribution* component.

<br />

### Things we like

It depends upon the bug, but if possible, screenshots and/or screencasts
are good.

You can attach these to a bug report as an attachment, and they can be
very helpful.

<br />

### Step 3 - What happens next

When you create a bug report, the details for it are emailed to assigned
Aeolus staff members.

Whenever the bug report is updated, you will be automatically emailed.
For example, with details of subsequent investigation, a fix being
developed, and so on.

Your Bugzilla account has a [preferences
section](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/userprefs.cgi) too, in case you
want to change when emails occur. (can be useful)
