This is almost a mere relabeling of iwhd-0.991.

### Improvements (both minor)

* __Log messages showing when iwhd is started and stopped__
* __An improvement in a regression test script__

### Known Issues (existing in previous releases too)

* __iwhd is not very useful without mongod__  
  Ideally, iwhd would communicate its inability to do useful work when mongod
  isn't running, and when mongod becomes usable again iwhd would, too. However,
  currently, attempting to do things like create an object or an attribute in
  iwhd makes iwhd dereference NULL whenever mongod is unreachable.
