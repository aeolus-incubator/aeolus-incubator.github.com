Oz version 0.7.0 has been released. Release 0.7.0 is a bugfix and feature
release for Oz.

Highlighted improvements of Oz 0.7.0 are:

* Ability to use the "direct initrd injection" method to install Fedora/RHEL
  guests. This is an internal implementation detail, but can significantly
  speed up installs for Fedora or RHEL guests. (thanks for the tip from Kashyap
  Chamarthy)
* Support for Fedora-16 (thanks to Steve Dake for help in making this work)
* Use the serial port to announce guest boot, rather than a network port. This
  makes it so we no longer have to manipulate iptables, and gets us one step
  closer to having Oz run as non-root
* (for developers) Re-written unittests in python for speedier execution
* (for developers) Additional methods in the TDL class to merge in external
  package lists (thanks to Ian McLeod)

More documentation on Oz (including links on how to obtain it) is available:

For this release, Fedora 14, Fedora 15, and RHEL-6.1 packages are available.
