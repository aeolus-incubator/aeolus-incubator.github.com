There have been no significant changes to Image Warehouse proper, but enough
around infrastructure that a new release is warranted, if only to ease building
on Fedora 18 and Fedora rawhide.

### Improvements

* Tests work around a difference in how the latest version of curl works.
* Build-related fixes and portability improvements via gnulib.
* New and updated translations.
