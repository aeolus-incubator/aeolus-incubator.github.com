Oz version 0.4.0 has been released. Release 0.4.0 is a bugfix and feature
release for Oz.

Highlighted improvements of Oz 0.4.0 are:

* Automatic detection/use of cached JEOS images (the previous method required
  the user of the Oz libraries to detect whether the image was cached or not)
* Fixes to make Debian installs work for both x86_64 and i386
* Honor user-provided automatic installation files better, by not doing
  modifications
* Use pyparted to generate partitions on newly created disks (if necessary)
* Add support for Fedora 15
* Add the ability to supply an initial root/Administrator password to the
  diskimage
* Abort installs after 5 minutes of disk inactivity
* Use M2Crypto to generate SSH keys (if necessary)
* Some pydoc documentation (more of this to come in the future)
* Support for Ubuntu 11.04
* Support for RHEL-6.1

More documentation on Oz (including links on how to obtain it) is available:

For this release, Fedora 14 and RHEL-6.1 packages are available. Fedora 13
packages are no longer available, as that distribution is (or will soon be) out
of support.
