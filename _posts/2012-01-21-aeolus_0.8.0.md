We're very proud to present version 0.8.0 of Aeolus, the multi-cloud deployment
solution, sponsored by Red Hat.

This release is mostly UI improvements, along with many important bug fixes.

Installation of Aeolus is very straight forward, using the instructions on the
website:

64-bit packages are available for Fedora 15, 16, and RHEL 6.1+.

All testing and bug reports are greatly appreciated. They directly contribute
to improving the quality of future releases.

__NOTE -__ Although Aeolus is still some way from production quality, it is
suitable for testing.  
__Please don't use it with live data yet.__
