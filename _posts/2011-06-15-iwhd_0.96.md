### New features

* __Added VMware vSphere registration back-end__  
  Type is "fs-vmw".

* __The RHEV-M registration back-end can now import a just-uploaded template
  into a master storage domain__  
  See new POST parameter "cluster".

### Bug fixes

* __iwhd will segfault or hang less often during garbage collection__  
  \[bug introduced in 0.91, partially fixed in 0.94]

* __iwhd init system start script more reliable__  
  Prior to this release, the system init script for iwhd would mistakenly
  succeed even if mongod failed to start in time.

  Now, when mongod fails to start, the iwhd init script also fails.

* __It is now possible to use Windows.Domain\Administrator as a user name in
  a cloud with Windows credentials__  
  The backslash was causing an internal error due to improper JSON escaping.
