### New features

* __A registration to RHEV-M now returns the ID and diagnostic messages in the
  body of reply to POST request__  
  This permits registration of the same image several times, which helps when
  triaging problems. The old "ami-id" attribute is retained and remains the
  same across registration back-end types.

### Bug fixes

* __On Fedora systems, /etc/iwhd/conf.js is not overwritten anymore when
  upgrading the package__  
  Added %config(noreplace) to the rpm .spec file

* __Adapted to jansson-1.2's new, incompatible, changed API__  
  We can now build both with it and the older API

* __Do not leave a value of "pending xxxx" remaining in "ami-id" attribute in
  case of an error in registration process.__  
  When we did, no application or human administrator could tell if there was an
  error or a hung registration.
