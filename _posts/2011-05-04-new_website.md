The Aeolus Community have launched the second version of our main website.

Designed by Kyle Baker from the Red Hat User Experience (UX) Team, this one is
visually appealing, has a **much** cleaner look, and is very easy to locate
information in.

Importantly, this website begins addressing the needs of business and
non-technical Aeolus users. A marked improvement over the developer only focus
of the previous website.

It is expected this will be a key piece for Aeolus growing into the worlds best
cloud deployment software.

**UPDATE:** Although we mentioned Kyle Baker's UX Design work for the new site,
we unintentionally forgot to mention [Jakub Steiner's][1] significant work.
Jakub created the new Aeolus logo, did the majority of the heavy lifting for
the site's CSS, plus much more. Due to his effort, the site works well in all
major browsers, resizes and scales properly, loads quickly, and generally
behaves as it should. Thanks Jakub!

[Let us know][2] what you think. :)
