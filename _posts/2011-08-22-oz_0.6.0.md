Oz version 0.6.0 has been released. Release 0.6.0 is a bugfix and feature
release for Oz.

Highlighted improvements of Oz 0.6.0 are:

* The ability to specify the destination for the ICICLE output from oz-install
  and oz-generate-icicle
* pydoc class documentation for all internal Oz classes
* Automatic detection of KVM or QEMU at runtime (this allows oz to be used
  within virtual machines, although with a large performance hit)
* Less scary warning messages in the debug output
* Printing of the screenshot path when a build fails
* Ability to run multiple Oz installs of the same OS at the same time
* Support for OEL and ScientificLinux
* Support for RHEL-5.7
* Support for CentOS 6
* Support for OpenSUSE arbitrary file injection and command execution
* Ability to make the TDL (template) parsing enforce a root password
* Rejection of localhost URLs for repositories (since they must be reachable
  from the guest operating system, localhost URLs make no sense)

More documentation on Oz (including links on how to obtain it) is available:

For this release, Fedora 14, Fedora 15, and RHEL-6.1 packages are available.
