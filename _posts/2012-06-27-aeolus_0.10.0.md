A new stable Aeolus release is available, 0.10.0.

The team has been working on this for a while, getting things into solid shape.
As always, we really appreciate the bug reports, pointers, and general
assistance from all over. Please keep it coming. :)

Packages are available for Fedora 16 (64-bit) for this release.

* Fedora 17 packages are being worked on, but are not ready yet.
* RHEL/CentOS 6 packages are **not** planned for this release. This is a
  temporary thing only. They will be available for future releases.

Instructions to get and install Aeolus are on the website:
