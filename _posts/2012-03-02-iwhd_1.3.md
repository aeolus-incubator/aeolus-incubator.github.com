summary: "Image Warehouse 1.3 stable release"

Not much has changed in iwhd per se, but due to e.g., changes in mongod, some
tests in iwhd-1.2's regression suite were failing. Now they pass. Also, Pete
Zaitcev documented some of the inner workings.

### Changes in behavior

* __iwhd --auto (-a) now uses mongod's --nojournal option when possible__

### Infrastructure

* __Translations now come from the translationproject.org, rather than from
  transifex__

Along with build-related fixes and portability improvements via gnulib.
