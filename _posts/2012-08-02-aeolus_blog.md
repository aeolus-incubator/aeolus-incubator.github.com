We now have a project blog, at [http://blog.aeolusproject.org][1].

We hope to use it to share not only project announcements, but to routinely
post interesting news that's related, updates on sprint progress, new features,
and more.

We would love additional contributors as well! Just email [Matt Wagner][2] or
[Justin Clift][3] with your preferred username and we'll set you up with an
account! Developers, you're encouraged to post often about what you're working
on. Community members and users, feel free to request an account and post about
how you use Aeolus or whatnot.

We can also syndicate RSS feeds from other sites, so if you have an existing
blog and a category for Aeolus-related content, please let us know.

Check it out today!
