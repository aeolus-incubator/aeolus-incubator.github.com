Features and benefits of Aeolus
===============================

<div class="section-grouping">
Key features
------------

Aeolus provides key features for a powerful Cloud solution:

-   Creation of Cloud resources

-   Managment of policies and work-flows around those resources

-   Governing access and permissions for the resources

Quotas, quality-of-service, and security policies are also under
administrator control.

End-users can be given access to a *self-service* web interface, for
provisioning resources subject to policy constraints.
